# 🏃 Sprint to the Goal

In the winter of 2024, I tore my ACL. Rehab was challenging both physically and mentally and getting back into walking and running wasn’t easy. What started as a small joke project turned into something much more meaningful: a way to apply my growing programming skills, track my recovery, and stay motivated throughout the process. Sprint to the Goal became both a coding exercise and a personal accountability tool on my journey to full rehabilitation.

## What It Does
- Parses and analyzes personal walking/running data from JSON
- Calculates total stats (distance, pace, calories, etc.)
- Compares performance over time
- Helps me stay accountable and motivated

## Program Structure
- sprint-to-the-goal/
  - data folder
    - sprint_data.json – Walk/run recovery logs (distance, steps, calories, pace)
  - scripts folder
    - analyze_walks.py – Python script analyzing data & generating performance trends
  - README.md – Overview of the project and insights
  - visualization folder (coming soon)







## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Power BI
- JSON

## What I Learned
- Data handling with JSON
- Coding discipline and learning by trying.
- How to turn real life progress into engaging data projects

## Next Steps
- Visualize trends
- Add a GUI (Tkinter or Streamlit)
- Integrate with MyFitnessPal or Apple Health API
