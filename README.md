# üèÉ Sprint to the Goal

In the winter of 2024, I tore my ACL. Rehab was challenging both physically and mentally and getting back into walking and running wasn‚Äôt easy. What started as a small joke project turned into something much more meaningful: a way to apply my growing programming skills, track my recovery, and stay motivated throughout the process. Sprint to the Goal became both a coding exercise and a personal accountability tool on my journey to full rehabilitation.

## What It Does
- Parses and analyzes personal walking/running data from JSON
- Calculates total stats (distance, pace, calories, etc.)
- Compares performance over time
- Helps me stay accountable and motivated

## Program Structure
- sprint-to-the-goal/
  - apps folder
  - data folder
    - sprint_data.json ‚Äì Walk/run recovery logs (distance, steps, calories, pace)
  - scripts folder
    - archive folder
    - analyze_walks.py ‚Äì Python script analyzing data & generating performance trends
    - sprint_app.py - Using streamlit, pandas, matplotlib, I create an application to enhance my tracker
  - README.md ‚Äì Overview of the project and insights

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Power BI
- JSON
- Matplotlib
- Streamlit

## What I Learned
- Building Real-World Applications: I am developing a personal fitness tracking app using Streamlit, turning real-life progress into interactive data visualizations.
- Working with Data: I deepened my understanding of JSON data structures, using pandas to clean, filter, and analyze my own fitness data.
- Data Visualization: I used matplotlib to create charts that help me visualize patterns in my activity, including trends in distance, calories burned, and pacing over time.
- Command Line Skills: I improved my comfort using the command line (CMD) to manage my project, run applications, handle virtual environments, and perform Git operations efficiently.
- Independent Problem Solving: More than anything, I learned how to build by using documentation, trial and error, and targeted research.
- Impact: Not only did this help enhance my programming and data analysis skills, but also positively impact my health, pushing me towards filling in more data!
   
## Next Steps
- Make an application {CREATING RIGHT NOW}
- Integrate with MyFitnessPal or Apple Health API
