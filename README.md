# 🏃 Sprint to the Goal

In the winter of 2024, I tore my ACL. Rehab was challenging—both physically and mentally—and getting back into walking and running wasn’t easy. What started as a small joke project turned into something much more meaningful: a way to apply my growing programming skills, track my recovery, and stay motivated throughout the process. Sprint to the Goal became both a coding exercise and a personal accountability tool on my journey to full rehabilitation.

## What It Does
- Parses and analyzes personal walking/running data from JSON
- Calculates total stats (distance, pace, calories, etc.)
- Compares performance over time
- Visualizes trends (like pace improvements 📉) (Coming Soon)
- Helps me stay accountable and motivated

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Power BI
- JSON

## What I Learned
- Data handling with JSON
- Coding discipline and learning by trying.
- How to turn real-life progress into engaging data projects

## Next Steps
- Visualize trends
- Add a GUI (Tkinter or Streamlit)
- Integrate with MyFitnessPal or Apple Health API
