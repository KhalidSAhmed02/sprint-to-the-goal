# sprint-to-the-goal
I tore my ACL in winter 0f 2024. Rehab sucked and trying to get back to running and walking again was a pain. I made this mini little project as a joke but then it transformed as the gateway to implement my learning. As well as keep me motivated to walk as many times as I can on my path to rehabilitation!
